    review: "An absolute gem. The hand-pulled noodles here are made fresh to order — you can watch them stretch the dough right in front of you. I had the spicy beef noodle soup and it was transcendent: a deep, complex broth with tender braised beef and just the right amount of chili heat. The scallion pancakes were flaky and golden. Portions are generous, prices are fair, and the no-frills dining room has real character. This is the kind of place you tell your friends about.",
