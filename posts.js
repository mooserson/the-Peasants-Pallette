    review: "Tucked away on a quiet side street, Mama Rosa's serves up some of the most comforting Italian food I've had in a long time. The rigatoni bolognese was rich and hearty — clearly simmered for hours. The garlic bread was perfectly crisp on the outside, soft and buttery within. Service was warm and unhurried. My only gripe: the tiramisu was a touch too sweet. But I'll be back for that pasta alone.",

    review: "An absolute gem. The hand-pulled noodles here are made fresh to order — you can watch them stretch the dough right in front of you. I had the spicy beef noodle soup and it was transcendent: a deep, complex broth with tender braised beef and just the right amount of chili heat. The scallion pancakes were flaky and golden. Portions are generous, prices are fair, and the no-frills dining room has real character. This is the kind of place you tell your friends about.",
